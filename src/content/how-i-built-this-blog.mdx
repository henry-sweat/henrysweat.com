**_"Why reinvent the wheel when platforms like Medium exist?"_** - _hackerNewsCommenter_

**_"This could easily be an Express server serving static HTML."_** - _anonymousRedditUser_

This is the general sentiment from engineers when they see _another_ custom blog of any complexity. It holds a lot of truth considering the ease of spinning up an Express server or making a Medium account. So, this project needed to be simple and intentional in order to justify its existence.

## The Goal

**Maximize:** user experience and developer experience

**Minimize:** time and effort

For UX, I'm concerned with how quickly the client can render the first bit of content to the DOM and the amount of JavaScript required client-side to fully render the page. For DX, the goal is to minimize the time and effort needed for both end-to-end development and for adding/updating blog posts.

## What Tools and Why

### next.js

Letâ€™s hear out the above concerns. Suppose I have an Express server running and sending the rendered HTML of my blog posts to the client. But, it needs styling, and manually styling this blog would be inefficient when `@tailwindcss/typography` exists.

As a result, the amount of JavaScript being sent to the client has increased, with most of it being unused `tailwind` code. To mitigate this, I install and configure `webpack` to perform tree shaking and bundling on the JavaScript sent to the client.

Additionally, I install a markdown library because writing a blog post in HTML is clunky and truly unnecessary.

I still want server-side rendering, which is a fancy phrase for sending raw HTML as the response to an HTTP request, so I ensure the translation from markdown to html is happening server-side.

So far, this app has:

- a backend
- styling libraries
- bundling
- server-side rendering

Effectively, I recreated the basics of next.js without getting any of its additional features. Yes, it is entirely feasible to build this blog using Express, a bundler, and a handful of third-party libraries. But, it is also true that frameworks are valuable, and using them without compromising user experience or developer workload is justified.

Iâ€™ll stick with `npx create-next-app@latest`.

### mdx.js

Writing the blog posts in markdown was about developer convenience. It's simply quicker to write markdown than HTML, and mdx.js enhances this by enabling JSX-embedded markdown. This means you can add custom React components inline with markdown. Explore their [website](https://mdxjs.com/) and see the following tweet rendered from a custom Tweet componentâ€”a feature uniquely afforded by `mdx` and `react-tweet`.

### "CMS"

All blog posts are stored in a `/content` directory on the server. When you visit this page _/blog/how-i-built-this-blog_, the page retrieves the how-i-built-this-blog.mdx file in the `/content` folder, parses the markdown to HTML, and sends the fully rendered page over to you. This approach comes with built-in version control via Git, and updating a blog post is as simple as editing a markdown file and pushing those changes. Love it. ðŸŽ¯

## Bringing It All Together

Our goals were:

1. _minimize the time it takes for the client to render the first bit of content to the DOM_

With next.js, all of the blog posts are rendered on the server at request-time, then served to the client efficiently. This ensures the shortest amount of time possible for the client to begin seeing data on their screen.

2. _minimize the amount of JavaScript needed client-side to fully render the page_

Since every blog post is a React Server Component, the page is fully rendered on the server ensuring minimial processing on the client.

3. _minimize the time and effort for end-to-end development_

With `npx create-next-app@latest`, development is focused on the blog landing page, dynamic routing required to serve individual blog posts, the markdown parsing functions, any custom components with `mdx`, and styling with `tailwindcss`.

4. _minimize the time and effort for adding/updating the blog posts_

To add a new blog post to the blog, simply drop a new .mdx file into the content directory. And, to update existing blog posts, make the necessary changes directly in the markdown files.

### File Structure

My blog lives under the _/blog_ route on my personal site, which is a next.js application. Below is trimmed down look at the files directly associated with the blog functionality.

3 folders, 4 files, plus 1 file for each blog post:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ /blog  // route for blog landing page
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /[slug]  // dynamic route for blog posts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx // Page Component for blog posts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mdx.tsx // custom MDX components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx // Page Component for blog landing page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog.ts // retrieve blog-post.mdx and convert to html
â””â”€â”€ /content // directory for storing blog posts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog-post.mdx // example blog post file
```

### Closing Thoughts

At first glance, making a blog might appear to be trivial or mundane; and it still might be. But, without having to bear the load of complex technical requirements and deadlines that come with client-work, building this blog deepened my appreciation and understanding of the nuances of my web application that otherwise would usually go unnoticed. For such a simple application, the tools become increasingly difficult to justify. Writing this blog post forced me to have a clear rationale for each one that I used.

Now, I have my rebuttal to the question, "Why isnâ€™t this just an Express server?"

Much of my inspiration came from the blogs of [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/blog) and [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/); both blogs are strikingly clean and efficient.
