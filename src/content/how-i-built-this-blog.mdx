**_"Why reinvent the wheel when platforms like Medium exist?"_** - _hackerNewsCommenter_

**_"This could easily be an Express server serving static HTML."_** - _anonymousRedditUser_

This is the general sentiment from engineers when they see _another_ custom blog of any complexity. However, there is a lot of truth to it given the ease of spinning up an express server or making a medium account. So, I wanted this project to be simple and intentional in order to justify its existence.

1. [The Goal](#the-goal)
2. [What Tools and Why](#what-tools-and-why)
3. [Bringing It All Together](#bringing-it-all-together)

## The Goal

**Maximize:** user experience and developer experience

**Minimize:** time and effort

For UX, we care about the time it takes for the client to render the first bit of content to the DOM and the amount of JavaScript needed client-side to fully render the page. For DX, it is minimizing the time and effort for both end-to-end development and adding/updating the blog posts.

## What Tools and Why

### next.js

Let‚Äôs hear out the above concerns. I have my express server running and it‚Äôs sending the rendered html of my blog posts to the client. Now comes the time to style this blog‚Äì and, admittedly, I'm lazy. So, I install `tailwindcss` to take advantage of its pre-built classes.

As a result, the amount of javascript being sent to the client has increased, with most of it being unused tailwind code. I install and configure `webpack` to perform tree shaking and bundling on the javascript that is being sent to the client in order to reduce the bundle size.

Writing a blog post in html is clunky and truly unnecessary, therefore I install a markdown library to produce html from text.

I still want server-side rendering, which again, is not that difficult with purely static content on an express server. Server-side rendering is a fancy phrase for sending raw html as the response to an HTTP request, so I just need to make sure the translation from markdown to html is happening server-side.

So far, my blog has:

- a backend
- styling libraries
- bundling
- server-side rendering

Effectively, I recreated the basics of next.js without its additional features. Yes, it is entirely feasible to build this blog using Express, a bundler, and a handful of third-party libraries. But, it is also true that frameworks are valuable, and using them without compromising user experience or developer workload is justified.

I‚Äôll stick with `npx create-next-app@latest`.

### mdx.js

Writing the blog posts in markdown was about developer convenience. It's simply quicker to write than HTML, and mdx.js enhances this by enabling JSX-embedded markdown. This enables custom React components inline with markdown. Explore their [website](https://mdxjs.com/) and see the following tweet showcased in a custom Tweet component‚Äîa feature uniquely afforded by `mdx` and `react-tweet`.

### "CMS"

All blog posts are stored in a `/content` directory on the server. When you visit this page _/blog/how-i-built-this-blog_, the page retrieves the how-i-built-this-blog.mdx file in the content folder, parses the markdown to html, and sends the fully rendered page over to you. This approach comes with built-in version control through git, and updating a blog post is as simple as editing a markdown file and pushing those changes. Love it. üéØ

## Bringing It All Together

Our goals were:

1. _minimize time it takes for the client to render the first bit of content to the DOM_

With next.js, all of the blog posts are rendered on the server at request-time, then served to the client efficiently. This ensures the shortest amount of time possible for the client to begin seeing data on their screen.

2. _minimize the amount of JavaScript needed client-side to fully render the page_

Since every blog post is a React Server Component, the page is fully rendered on the server ensuring minimial processing on the client to render the page completely.

3. _minimize the time and effort for end-to-end development_

With `npx create-next-app@latest`, the only development left is the blog landing page, dynamic routing required to serve individual blog posts, the markdown parsing functions, any custom components with `mdx`, and styling with `tailwindcss`.

4. _minimize the time and effort adding/updating the blog posts_

To add a new blog post to the blog, simply drop a new .mdx file into the content directory. And, to update existing blog posts, make the necessary changes directly in the markdown files.

### Closing Thoughts

At first glance, making a blog might appear to be trivial or mundane; and it still might be. But, without having to bear the cognitive load of complex technical requirements and deadlines that comes with client-work, building this blog helped me appreciate and understand the nuances of my web application that otherwise would usually go unnoticed. For such a simple application, the tools become increasingly difficult to justify. Writing this blog post forced me to justify those choices. And, now I have a response to the echoes of ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt this just an Express server?‚Äù

Much of my inspiration came from the blogs of [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/blog) and [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/); both blogs are incredibly clean and efficient.
