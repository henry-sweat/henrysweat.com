## Notes

All information is encoded as 0's and 1's in a computer.

A computer just performs operations on the encoded information.

Two themes of the book:

1. notion of abstraction
2. don't separate hardware from software

"Software and hardware are names for components of two parts of a computing system that work best when they are designed by someone who took into account the capabilities and limitations of both"

A computer does two things:

1. directs the processing of information
2. performs the actual processing of that information

CPU: central processing unit, aka processor. Usually consists of a single microprocessor on a piece of silicon material

the microprocessor is made up of up many millions of transistors

Two big ideas:

1. All computers are capable of computing the exact same things if they are given enough time and memory. All computer do the exactly the same thing, some just do them faster.
2. Our problems are described in english, yet the problems are solved by electrons running around inside the computer. We must transform our problems from spoken language to the voltages that influence the flow of electrons.

Computer as a universal computation device. It can add AND multiply AND any other computation that you can come up with.

They can compute anything because they are programmable.

Levels of transformation from human language to electrons:

1. problems
2. algorithms
3. language
4. machine (ISA) architecture
5. microarchitecture
6. circuits
7. devices
